You can support by adjusting one of the [springwolf examples](https://github.com/springwolf/springwolf-core/tree/master/springwolf-examples), so that it reproduces your scenario:
> 1. Fork this repo (`springwolf-core`) in GitHub and `git clone` it
> 2. Adjust classes, etc. in one of the `springwolf-examples`
> 3. Push your local changes to a branch on your fork (`git commit`, `git push`)
> 4. Open a `Pull Request` (a notification will appear in your fork as soon as you push your branch), the title should include `reproduce` and ideally the link to the issue.
