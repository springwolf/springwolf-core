# Springwolf AsyncAPI

### About

This library provides a JVM-friendly binding to generate the AsyncAPI spec 3.0. The spec 3.0 is documented on
[AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) in a human friendly way, with [AsyncAPI spec & examples](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec) 
being the concrete specification.

All bindings are documented in a separate [AsyncAPI Bindings](https://github.com/asyncapi/bindings) repo. This repo
contains example files, which are heavily used in the tests to ensure conformity of this library to the AsyncAPI spec.

Even when this library can be used by any JVM system, it's main goal is to support Springwolf-Core.

### Usage

Add the following dependencies and configuration class to enable this plugin.

#### Dependencies

```groovy
dependencies {
    // Provides the JVM Builders to create an AsyncAPI Spec file    
    implementation 'io.github.springwolf:springwolf-asyncapi:<springwolf-version>'
}
```

### Configuration class

```java
        AsyncAPI asyncAPI = AsyncAPI.builder()
                .info(Info.builder()
                        .title("Account Service")
                        .version("1.0.0")
                        .description("This service is in charge of processing user signups")
                        .build())
                .channels(Map.of(
                        "userSignedup",
                        Channel.builder().build()))
                .operations(Map.of(
                        "sendUserSignedup",
                        Operation.builder().build()))
                .build();
```
