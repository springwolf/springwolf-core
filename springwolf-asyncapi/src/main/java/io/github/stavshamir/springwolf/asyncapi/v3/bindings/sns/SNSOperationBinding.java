/**
 * This object contains information operation binding in SNS.
 * </p>
 * We represent SNS producers via a subscribe Operation Object. In simple cases this may not require configuration, and
 * can be shown as an empty SNS Binding Object i.e. {} if you need to explicitly indicate how a producer publishes to
 * the channel.
 * </p>
 * We represent SNS consumers via a publish Operation Object. These consumers need an SNS Subscription that defines how
 * they consume from SNS i.e. the protocol that they use, and any filters applied.
 * </p>
 * The SNS binding does not describe the receiver.If you wish to define the receiver, add a publish Operation Binding
 * Object for that receiver. For example, if you send message to an SQS queue from an SNS Topic, you would add a
 * protocol of 'sqs' and an Identifier object for the queue. That identifier could be an ARN of a queue defined outside
 * of the scope of AsyncAPI, but if you wanted to define the receiver you would use the name of a queue defined in an
 * SQS Binding on the publish Operation Binding Object.
 * </p>
 * We support an array of consumers via the consumers field. This allows you to represent multiple protocols consuming
 * an SNS Topic in one file. You may also use it for multiple consumers with the same protocol, instead of representing
 * each consumer in a separate file.
 *
