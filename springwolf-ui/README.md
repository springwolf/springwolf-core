### Mock Data

The application renders content based on mock data in `src/app/shared/mock`.
It contains multiple mocks - including the ones from the springwolf-core examples projects.

To update the mock data, run `npm run update-mocks`.

## Release

Releasing is done by running the gradle task `publish`. For local development, use `publishToMavenLocal`.

Use the following environment variables:
- ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_SIGNINGKEY: Output of `gpg --armor --export-secret-key`
- ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_SIGNINGPASSWORD: Password for the gpg key
